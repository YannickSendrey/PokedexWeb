# PokedexWeb ðŸ’«

## Introduction

ðŸŒ± 2nd project I made during the month of September in my free time while still following a 6 month bootcamp via O'clock. 

### You can access it there ðŸ‘‰ https://pokedex-web-yannicksendrey.vercel.app/ ðŸ‘ˆ

Building a pokedex was a good idea to me to easily practice several web development concepts.

I went more in-depth in this one than the 1st one, had the occasion to :
- Create a more thorough project documentation **(MCD / MLD / Wireframes / User Stories / API Routes)**
- Build a coherent database and host it via cloud hoisting
- Build a Backend API with **Laravel**, **dockerize** it to host it remotely
- Build a **responsive** Frontend with **React**
- Handle intern state with Redux, most of it via asynchronous API calls (Redux thunk) 

## App

Several features on this one :
- browse all pokemons up to gen V (included)
- filter them by region
- search for a specific name while in homePage 
- access a specific pokemon and its detailed data via several ways (onClick image/name, searchInput)

Had the occasion for the first time to handle a register/login/logout via **JWT tokens**

A feature is only accessible while logged in :
- add up to 6 pokemons to your team from their detailed data page
- navigate to your profile to see them / remove any of them

## Design

Even though it is far from perfect, and quite simple, I'm more satisfied with this one ! 
Used a very classic color chart nowadays, but still spent a lot of time polishing the responsive aspect of the app.
Striving to do continue to do better everytime !

# Conclusion

Very happy to release this second side project. Worked on it through september while following my classes @O'clock. 
Took me around (~50h) in total I'd say (if I don't count the 20 hours i spent trying to dockerize it ðŸ™„, for sure the hardest part of this project !
